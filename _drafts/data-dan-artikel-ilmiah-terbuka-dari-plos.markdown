Public Library of Science (PLOS)

PLOS was founded as a nonprofit Open Access publisher, innovator and advocacy organization with a mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. \

OPEN is no longer just about free and unrestricted access to research, it's also about open data, transparency in peer review and an open approach to science assessment.

OPEN is a mindset that represents the best scientific values. One that focuses on bringing scientists together, to share work as rapidly and as widely as possible, to advance science faster and to benefit society as a whole.
